# Titanic Dataset Preprocessing Project

This project aims to preprocess the Titanic dataset using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.

**Introduction**

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for teaching basic machine learning concepts. This project focuses on preprocessing the dataset, which includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and scaling features.

**Dependencies**

This project requires the following dependencies:


Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn


**Preprocessing Steps**

Loading the dataset into the Python environment.

Making 'PassengerId' as the index column.

Checking the basic details of the dataset (e.g., info, head, describe).

Filling in all missing values present in all columns.

Checking and handling outliers in at least three columns in the dataset.

Performing min-max scaling on the feature set.
